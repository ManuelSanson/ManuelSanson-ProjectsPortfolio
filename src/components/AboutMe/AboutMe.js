                <p className='sectionParagraph'> I am relatively new to this world. I started by learning Python, and I found coding quite fun and challenging. Since then, I decided to start learning Web Development and enrolled in Coderhouse to take their one-year Full Stack Development career. The Full Stack career is composed of four blocks: Web Development, JavaScript, ReactJS and Backend Development. I have already completed the Frontend courses and I am currently taking the last one, Backend Development. In these courses I have acquired knowledge of ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, Git, Github and Firebase, among others. </p>
                <p className='sectionParagraph'> On a different note, I have a background in Translation, since I received a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Public Translation from the Universidad of Montevideo and I work as Translator since 2017. This has enabled me to develop certain skills that I deem key for coding, such as English proficiency, attention to detail, creativity, organization skills, capacity to work in teams, among others. </p>
                <p className='sectionParagraph'> As you can see on my <Link onClick={()=> scrollToSection(projects)} className='projectsLink'> PROJECTS </Link> section above, , I have several projects that validate my skills acquired so far. And I am really eager to continue developing such skills. I would say my main area of expertise is landing pages, but I am excited for taking up any new projects. </p>
